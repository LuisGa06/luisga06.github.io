            <h3>About the Chow Chow dog</h3>
            <p>The distinctive-looking Chow Chow dog breed has a proud, independent spirit that some describe as catlike. They can be aloof — if you’re looking for a cuddle buddy, this probably isn’t the best breed for you — and downright suspicious of strangers. But for the right person, they can be a fiercely loyal companion</p>

            <h3>Origin and history</h3>
            <h4>Breef origin</h4>
            <p>A breed of dog that differs from most others in having a blue-black tongue. The breed originated in China and is known to date to the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220); it is believed by some to be one of the oldest of all breeds and is genetically very close to the wolf. The name chow chow is apparently derived from an English term used in the 19th century to refer to cargo from the Orient.</p>

                    <h4>History of the Chow Chow</h4>
                    <p>The Chow Chow as it is known today, is represented in the pottery and sculptures of the Han Chinese Dynasty (206 AC to 22 AC); other sources indicate that it was still a much more old race and can have come originally from the Arctic Circle, then migrated into Mongolia, Siberia, and China.</p>
                    <p>With the ending of the Tang dynasty came an increasing national poverty and, except within the monasteries, selective breeding ceased.  The original pure Chow breed only stayed in the houses of the richest merchants, some noble, and in the monasteries.</p>

If you have any particular health concerns about your dog’s diet and nutrition – including weight, dietary restrictions, or even deciphering what ‘human’ foods are safe to feed your Chow – speak with your veterinarian. They can provide you with professional advice and recommendations on the nutrients your Chow Chow needs, whether he’s a pup or a senior dog.</p>
